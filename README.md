# FizzBuzzer
TDD and clean code practice using classic FizzBuzz problem...

A program that prints numbers from 1 to X. 
But for multiples of three, "FIZZ" is printed instead of the number. 
For multiples of five, "BUZZ" is printed instead. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, "FIZZBUZZ" is printed.
